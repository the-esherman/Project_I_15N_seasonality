# Project I - 15N seasonality

## Part of PhD studies of Emil A.S. Andersen

<!-- badges: start -->

This project is for analysis (and maybe data cleaning) of a year-round
seasonal project that dealt with plant nitrogen uptake in a subarctic
ecosystem located in the north of Sweden.

To better work with and across with other collaborators, I will make
certain parts of this project public.
